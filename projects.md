## Interchange

![interchange-screenshots.png](assets/interchange-screenshots.png "Screenshots of Interchange.")

**An iOS app for college transit, currently available for Chapman University.** 
View routes, shuttle locations, and estimated arrival times in a sleek, easy-to-use
interface. I built this app to address a gap in user experience, and this is
just the beginning, with much more to come in the future.

**A game about not waking up a hungover corgi named Sandie.** Gather 2-4 people,
roll to determine order, and take turns to pet Sandie. Don’t wake her up…*or else*.

I worked on gameplay programming in Unity, and collaborated with 
[Nicole Citardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-citardi-16104a222/), 
[Veronica Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicalan/), and 
[Daniel Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ahn-bb2326262/) to coordinate 
UI development, artwork integration, and version control. There were so many
moving parts, and I really aimed to get as much input for the gameplay design
as I could from the team.
