## Interchange

**An iOS app for college transit, currently available for Chapman University.** 
View routes, shuttle locations, and estimated arrival times in a sleek, easy-to-use
interface. I built this app to address a gap in user experience, and this is
just the beginning, with much more to come in the future.
