# Projects

## Interchange

![interchange-screenshots.png](assets/interchange-screenshots.png "Screenshots of Interchange.")

**An iOS app for college transit, currently available for Chapman University.** 
View routes, shuttle locations, and estimated arrival times in a sleek, easy-to-use
interface. I built this app to address a gap in user experience, and this is
just the beginning, with much more to come in the future.

**A game about not waking up a hungover corgi named Sandie.** Gather 2-4 people,
roll to determine order, and take turns to pet Sandie. Don’t wake her up…*or else*.

I worked on gameplay programming in Unity, and collaborated with 
[Nicole Citardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-citardi-16104a222/), 
[Veronica Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicalan/), and 
[Daniel Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ahn-bb2326262/) to coordinate 
UI development, artwork integration, and version control. There were so many
moving parts, and I really aimed to get as much input for the gameplay design
as I could from the team.

## Sourcebook

![sourcebook.png](assets/sourcebook.png "Screenshot of Sourcebook, a lightweight CMS for class websites.")

**A lightweight content management system (CMS) designed to build class websites.**
I designed it to be a self-hosted alternative for popular apps like Notion, while
offering additional features tailored to support schoolwork.

I designed an entity-relationship diagram, MySQL database schema, and HTML/CSS
high-fidelity prototype to support the project and show to professors. I then
built a lightweight full-stack application using Python, Flask, and MySQL.

## Tad-Pool

**A mobile app designed to make carpooling easier for college students.**
Find carpools based on time and location, and get rewarded for helping to reduce
CO2 emissions. I worked with [Jazmine Stanek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjazminestanek/)
and [Isabelle Woo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellewoo/) to create the UI/UX
design using Figma and FigJam, in a period of 24 hours for
[FullyBeyond 2024](https://fullybeyond.acmcsuf.com/).

The project reached the finalist judging stage.

## Power to the People

**An iPhone app designed to make traffic stops safer for marginalized communities.**
Record interactions with police, assign and text emergency contacts, and be informed
of your rights. I led a student team of 4 to build a minimum viable product using
SwiftUI, in 36 hours. The app was selected for the **Organizer’s Pick award** at
[CruzHacks 2024](https://cruzhacks.com/), the premier hackathon of UC Santa Cruz.

## The Farmer's Dog Trivia Game

![farmers-dog.png](assets/farmers-dog.png)

**A Windows kiosk application designed to connect customers with the Farmer's
Dog experience.** Play the interactive trivia game, score points, and win swag!
I worked with [Walter Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-j-cheng/) to
plan out dependencies and requirements, set up the codebase, and implement the
screens for the app using React Native for Windows. 

"I’ve worked with Brendan for many years, and he is the first person I turn to
for web/app development. He’s knowledgeable and efficient, and his task
management skills make him an ideal project member." — Walter Cheng, project overseer
