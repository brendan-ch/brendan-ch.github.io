# Brendan Chen

**I'm Brendan, a third-year software engineering student at 
[Chapman University](https://chapman.edu/).** I'm currently working on [Interchange](https://interchange.bchen.dev), an app to streamline the college transit experience.

I'm also actively engaged in student organizations such as Seishun Taiko and Panther Devs, Chapman's game development club.

I'm simply interested in creating with software, experimenting with ideas, and learning from others. I view programming and engineering as creative outlets where I can put people, both customers and teammates, at the center of everything I do.
