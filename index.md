# Brendan Chen

**I'm Brendan, a recently graduated Software Engineering student who attended [Chapman University](https://chapman.edu/).** I was previously a digital technology intern at [Cargill](https://cargill.com), working in the Branded Feed business to create new digital experiences. I'm also the creator of [Interchange](https://interchange.bchen.dev), a free app to streamline the Chapman transit experience.

I recently published an essay on Substack, [writing about how I experienced LLMs as a student](https://bchendev.substack.com/p/reflections-on-llms-as-a-student?utm_source=bchen.dev).

I see myself as a technologist interested in creating with software and learning from others. I view programming as a creative outlet: one where I continuously [wrangle the machine](https://blog.jsbarretto.com/post/on-llms) to create a boring solution.

I'm on [Substack](https://bchendev.substack.com?utm_source=bchen.dev), [GitHub](https://github.com/brendan-ch), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brendan-ch). You may also [email me](mailto:me@bchen.dev).
