# Brendan Chen

**I'm Brendan, a fourth-year Software Engineering student at 
[Chapman University](https://chapman.edu/).** I'm currently a digital technology intern at [Cargill](https://cargill.com), working within the Branded Feed business to create new digital experiences. I'm also working on [Interchange](https://interchange.bchen.dev), an app to streamline the college transit experience.

I'm simply interested in creating with software, experimenting with ideas, and learning from others. I view programming and engineering as creative outlets where I can put people, both customers and teammates, at the center of everything I do.
