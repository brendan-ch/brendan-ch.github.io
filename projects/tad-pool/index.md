# Tad-Pool

![tad-pool.png](assets/tad-pool.png "Screenshots of Tad-Pool, a carpooling app for college students.")

**A mobile app designed to make carpooling easier for college students.** Find
carpools based on time and location, and get rewarded for helping to reduce CO2
emissions. I worked with [Jazmine Stanek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjazminestanek/)
and [Isabelle Woo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellewoo/) to create the UI/UX
design using Figma and FigJam, in a period of 24 hours for
[FullyBeyond 2024](https://fullybeyond.acmcsuf.com/).

The project reached the finalist judging stage.
