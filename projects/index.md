## Interchange

![interchange-screenshots.png](assets/interchange-screenshots.png "Screenshots of Interchange.")

**An iOS app for college transit, currently available for Chapman University.** 
View routes, shuttle locations, and estimated arrival times in a sleek, easy-to-use
interface. I built this app using SwiftUI, Node.js and Apollo GraphQL, with Redis as a
primary storage mechanism.

**A proof-of-concept tutoring app for students learning math.** Using the phone camera,
the app sees and understands math problems, guiding students through problems with hints
and step-by-step questions. We added text-to-speech (TTS) to give our app a voice, further
engaging students and making it feel like a more personal experience.

I built the app using SwiftUI. using AVFoundation for video recording and TTS playback.
[Tri Vu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-q-vu/) built a web interface prototype and Python-based
backend utilizing the Gemini Vision API and Fish Audio for TTS.

![power-to-the-people.png](assets/power-to-the-people.png "Screenshots of Power to the People, an iOS app designed to make traffic stops safer.")

**An iPhone app designed to make traffic stops safer for marginalized communities.**
Record interactions with police, assign and text emergency contacts, and be informed
of your rights. I led a student team of 4 to build a minimum viable product using
SwiftUI, in 36 hours. The app was selected for the **President's Pick award** at
[CruzHacks 2024](https://cruzhacks.com/), the premier hackathon of UC Santa Cruz.

## Tad-Pool

![tad-pool.png](assets/tad-pool.png "Screenshots of Tad-Pool, a carpooling app for college students.")

**A mobile app designed to make carpooling easier for college students.**
Find carpools based on time and location, and get rewarded for helping to reduce
CO2 emissions. I worked with [Jazmine Stanek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjazminestanek/)
and [Isabelle Woo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellewoo/) to create the UI/UX
design using Figma and FigJam, in a period of 24 hours for
[FullyBeyond 2024](https://fullybeyond.acmcsuf.com/).

The project reached the finalist judging stage.

**A game about not waking up a hungover corgi named Sandie.** Gather 2-4 people,
roll to determine order, and take turns to pet Sandie. Don’t wake her up…*or else*.

I worked on gameplay programming in Unity, and collaborated with 
[Nicole Citardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-citardi-16104a222/), 
[Veronica Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicalan/), and 
[Daniel Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ahn-bb2326262/) to coordinate 
UI development, artwork integration, and version control. There were so many
moving parts, and I really aimed to get as much input for the gameplay design
as I could from the team.

## Sourcebook

![sourcebook.png](assets/sourcebook.png "Screenshot of Sourcebook, a lightweight CMS for class websites.")

**A lightweight content management system (CMS) designed to build class websites.**
I designed it to be a self-hosted alternative for popular apps like Notion, while
offering additional features tailored to support schoolwork.

I designed an entity-relationship diagram, MySQL database schema, and HTML/CSS
high-fidelity prototype to support the project and show to professors. I then
built a lightweight full-stack application using Python, Flask, and MySQL.

## The Farmer's Dog Trivia Game

![farmers-dog.png](assets/farmers-dog.png)

**A Windows kiosk application designed to connect customers with the Farmer's
Dog experience.** Play the interactive trivia game, score points, and win swag!
I worked with [Walter Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-j-cheng/) to
plan out dependencies and requirements, set up the codebase, and implement the
screens for the app using React Native for Windows. 

"I’ve worked with Brendan for many years, and he is the first person I turn to
for web/app development. He’s knowledgeable and efficient, and his task
management skills make him an ideal project member." — Walter Cheng, project overseer
