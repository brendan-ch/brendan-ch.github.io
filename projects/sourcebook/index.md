**A lightweight content management system (CMS) designed to build class
websites.** I designed it to be a self-hosted alternative for popular apps like
Notion, while offering additional features tailored to support schoolwork.

I designed an entity-relationship diagram, MySQL database schema, and HTML/CSS
high-fidelity prototype to support the project and show to professors. I then
built a lightweight full-stack application using Python, Flask, and MySQL.
