**App development project for volunteer organization Techies Without Borders.** I helped implement the CMES mobile app using Ionic Capacitor and Angular, facilitating the download, viewing and playback of medical education content in resource-constrained countries. This app is actively used in medical facilities in Uganda and Nepal, to name a few.
