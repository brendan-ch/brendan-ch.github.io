**App development project for volunteer organization Techies Without Borders.** I helped implement the CMES mobile app, facilitating the download, viewing and playback of medical education content in resource-constrained countries.

In the early stages, I built the download screen and business logic, the PDF viewer integration, and background audio playback using native code. Later, I built the native web view to integrate with the [CMES-Pi](https://cmesworld.org/cmes_product-Pi.html) solution, simplifying the business logic while adding support for future edge platforms.

The app's front-end uses Capacitor and Angular, with several Capacitor plugins in Swift + Java to bundle native functionality.

This app is actively used in medical facilities in Uganda and Nepal, to name a few.
