**A game about not waking up a hungover corgi named Sandie.** Gather 2-4 people,
roll to determine order, and take turns to pet Sandie. Don’t wake her
up…*or else*.

I worked on gameplay programming in Unity, and collaborated with
[Nicole Citardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-citardi-16104a222/),
[Veronica Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicalan/), and
[Daniel Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ahn-bb2326262/) to coordinate
UI development, artwork integration, and version control. There were so many
moving parts, and I really aimed to get as much input for the gameplay design
as I could from the team.
