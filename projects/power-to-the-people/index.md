# Power to the People (CruzHacks 2024 President's Pick)

**An iPhone app designed to make traffic stops safer for marginalized
communities.** Record interactions with police, assign and text emergency
contacts, and be informed of your rights. I led a student team of 4 to build a
minimum viable product using SwiftUI, in 36 hours. The app was selected for the
**President's Pick award** at [CruzHacks 2024](https://cruzhacks.com/), the
premier hackathon of UC Santa Cruz.
