**An iPhone app designed to make traffic stops safer for marginalized communities.** Record interactions with police, assign and text emergency contacts, and be informed of your rights. I worked in a student team of 4, including David Sohn, Jacob Zamore, and Patrick Smith, to prototype and build a proof of concept in 36 hours. The app was selected for the **President's Pick award** at [CruzHacks 2024](https://cruzhacks.com/), the premier hackathon of UC Santa Cruz.

My contribution was the iOS app prototype, of which a demo is shown below. I built the primary user flow of recording a police interaction, simultaneously using the front and back iPhone cameras to capture all angles. Activating the recording also displays the "Know Your Rights" screen, displaying basic dos and don'ts. Finally, I built a way to view previous recordings and share the files using the iOS share sheet.
