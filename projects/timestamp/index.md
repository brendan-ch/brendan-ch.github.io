A simple, unintrusive Pomodoro timer for macOS which lives in the menu bar. I built it with SwiftUI and made it open source.

[Download the app](https://github.com/brendan-ch/timestamp/releases){: .primary-action }
[View the code](https://github.com/brendan-ch/timestamp){: .secondary-action }
{: .horizontal-wrapper }
