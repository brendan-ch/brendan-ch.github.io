**A Windows kiosk application designed to connect customers with the Farmer's
Dog experience.** Play the interactive trivia game, score points, and win swag!
I worked with [Walter Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-j-cheng/) to
plan out dependencies and requirements, set up the codebase, and implement the
screens for the app using React Native for Windows. 

"I’ve worked with Brendan for many years, and he is the first person I turn to
for web/app development. He’s knowledgeable and efficient, and his task
management skills make him an ideal project member." — Walter Cheng, project overseer
