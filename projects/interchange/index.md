# Interchange

![interchange-screenshots.png](assets/interchange-screenshots.png "Screenshots of Interchange.")

**An iOS app for college transit, currently available for Chapman University.**
View routes, shuttle locations, and estimated arrival times in a sleek,
easy-to-use interface. I built this app using SwiftUI, Node.js and Apollo
GraphQL, with Redis as a primary storage mechanism.
