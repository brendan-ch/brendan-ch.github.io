**A proof-of-concept tutoring app for students learning math.** Using the phone camera, the app sees and understands math problems, guiding students through problems with hints and step-by-step questions. We added text-to-speech (TTS) to give our app a voice, further engaging students and making it feel like a more personal experience.

I built the app using SwiftUI. with AVFoundation for video recording and TTS playback. [Tri Vu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-q-vu/) built a web interface prototype and Python-based backend utilizing the Gemini Vision API and Fish Audio for TTS.
